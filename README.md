# Description
This is a brief analysis which I did on the MTN telecommunication company in Cote D'Ivore. 
The main aim of this project was to determine the best way in which MTN can upgrade its infrastructure. This was done using mobile usage logs over three days. An analysis of the data was done using Python 3 and Excel to come up with the best strategy for MTN to upgrade its infrastructure. 

The best recommendation given for MTN to upgrade its infrastructure to a high-value network that is fast and reliable. It is also recommended that MTN starts its upgrade from the least used cities which are assumed to be with poor infrastucture. A detailed data report and analysis of what I did is available in the repository. Be sure to check it out.
